## About

This is a simple project based on the frontpage of Instagram. This project was part of the Bootcamp offered by Everis on the Digital Innovation One platform, and was guided by Gabriela Pinheiro.

## Customization

I just used svg files for the logo and badges and customized the smartphones image.

## Demo
